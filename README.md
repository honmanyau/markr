# Markr

This document describes the prototype of the data processing and storage microservice for Markr. It was created in fulfillment of a take-home coding challenge.

## Beginning Remarks

This section was written before all sections but is placed close to the end of this document because of the following statement:

> At Markr, people don't like to muck around - the most important requirements are therefore at the top of the list.

It may be worth noting that I read through the requirements 3 days ago and therefore already had a bit of a think about this for a few days. This section contains personal remarks "as I go" and read the requirements again, and is meant to be guidelines to myself.

I personally find that the estimated time of 2–3 hours for completing this challenge is non-trivial. While hacking together a working prototype within 3 hours is definitely possible, meeting most of the requirements described in the requirements will likely require the following time spent:

| Task | Duration / hour |
| ---- | --------------- |
| (Re-)reading, planning, designing, and writing documentation | 1.0 |
| Project setup | 0.5 |
| Producing a functional prototype | 1.5 |
| Basic error handling and tests | 0.5 |
| Cleaning up, refactoring, and *small* optimisations | 1.0 |
| Docker setup\* | 0.5 |
| Making sure that everything works before submission | 1.0 |

\* Not including the time needed to familiarise myself with Docker Compose since I haven't used that feature before.

The total time required for the tasks listed above is already 6 hours, and applying a conservative multiplier brings us too 9 hours — which sounds more realistic as an investment for a prototype that may "somehow find its way into production". At this point I must say that I'm honestly a bit nervous (and I thought I was going to calm myself by budgeting time first...) — this could mean my estimated scope is already too big compared to what is expected; my ability is below expectation; or both.

In any case, there is one way to move forward. The plan is to hack a fully functional prototype within 3 hours, and then incrementally address all of the requirements that are not met or of subpar qualities. Time to get started.
